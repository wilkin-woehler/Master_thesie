abstract = {We propose to describe the dynamics of phase transitions in terms of a nonstationary generalized Langevin equation for the order parameter. By construction, this equation is nonlocal in time, i.e., it involves memory effects whose intensity is governed by a memory kernel. In general, it is a hard task to determine the physical origin and the extent of the memory effects based on the underlying microscopic equations of motion. Therefore we propose to relate the extent of the memory kernel to quantities that are experimentally observed such as the induction time and the duration of the phase transformation process. Using a simple kinematic model, we show that the extent of the memory kernel is positively correlated with the duration of the transition, and that it is of the same order of magnitude, while the distribution of induction times does not have an effect on the memory kernel. This observation is tested at the example of several model systems, for which we have run computer simulations: a modified Potts model, a dipole gas, an anharmonic spring in a bath, and a nucleation problem. All these cases are shown to be consistent with the simple theoretical model.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) on the crystal nucleation of hard-sphere colloids for varying supersaturations. We use molecular dynamics and stochastic rotation dynamics techniques to account for the HIs. For high supersaturation values, we perform brute force simulations and compute the nucleation rate, obtaining good agreement with previous studies where HIs were neglected. In order to access low supersaturation values, we use a seeding approach method and perform simulations with and without HIs. We compute the nucleation rates for the two cases and surprisingly find good agreement between them. The nucleation rate in both cases follows the trend of the previous numerical results, thereby corroborating the discrepancy between experiments and simulations. Furthermore, we investigate the amount of fivefold symmetric clusters (FSCs) in a supersaturated fluid under different physical conditions, following the idea that FSCs compete against nucleation. To this end, we explore the role of the softness of the pair interactions, different solvent viscosities, and different sedimentation rates in simulations that include HIs. We do not find significant variations in the amount of FSCs, which might reflect the irrelevance of these three features on the nucleation process.},

abstract = {In the first part of a series of two papers, we present in considerable detail a collision-driven molecular dynamics algorithm for a system of nonspherical particles, within a parallelepiped simulation domain, under both periodic or hard-wall boundary conditions. The algorithm extends previous event-driven molecular dynamics algorithms for spheres. We present a novel partial-update near-neighbor list (NNL) algorithm that is superior to previous algorithms at high densities, without compromising the correctness of the algorithm. This efficiency of the algorithm is further increased for systems of very aspherical particles by using bounding sphere complexes (BSC). In the second part of this series of papers we apply the algorithm presented in the first part of this series of papers to systems of hard ellipses and ellipsoids. The theoretical machinery needed to treat such particles, including the overlap potentials, is developed in full detail. We describe an algorithm for predicting the time of collision for two moving ellipses or ellipsoids. We present performance results for our implementation of the algorithm. The practical utility of the algorithm is demonstrated by presenting several interesting physical applications, including the generation of jammed packings inside spherical containers, the study of contact force chains in jammed packings, and melting the densest-known equilibrium crystals of prolate spheroids.},

@article{Meyer2019,
abstract = {Complex microscopic many-body processes are often interpreted in terms of so-called "reaction coordinates," i.e., in terms of the evolution of a small set of coarse-grained observables. A rigorous method to produce the equation of motion of such observables is to use projection operator techniques, which split the dynamics of the observables into a main contribution and a marginal one. The basis of any derivation in this framework is the classical Heisenberg equation for an observable. If the Hamiltonian of the underlying microscopic dynamics and the observable under study do not explicitly depend on time, this equation is obtained by a straightforward derivation. However, the problem is more complicated if one considers Hamiltonians which depend on time explicitly as, e.g., in systems under external driving, or if the observable of interest has an explicit dependence on time. We use an analogy to fluid dynamics to derive the classical Heisenberg picture and then apply a projection operator formalism to derive the nonstationary generalized Langevin equation for a coarse-grained variable. We show, in particular, that the results presented for time-independent Hamiltonians and observables in the study by Meyer, Voigtmann, and Schilling, J. Chem. Phys. 147, 214110 (2017) can be generalized to the time-dependent case.},

Quadratic and third-order invariants formed from bond spherical harmonics allow quantitative measures of cluster symmetries in these systems. A state with short-range translational order, but extended correlations in the orientations of particle clusters, starts to develop about 10{\%} below the equilibrium melting temperature in a supercooled Lennard-Jones liquid. The order is predominantly icosahedral, although there is also a cubic component which we attribute to the periodic boundary conditions. Results are obtained for liquids cooled in an icosahedral pair potential as well. Only a modest amount of orientational order appears in a relaxed Finney dense-random-packing model. In contrast, we find essentially perfect icosahedral bond correlations in alternative "amorphon" cluster models of glass structure. {\textcopyright} 1983 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The dynamics of many-body complex processes is a challenge that many scientists from various fields have to face. Reducing the complexity of systems involving a large number of bodies in order to reach a simple description for observables captur- ing the main features of the process is a difficult task for which different approaches have been proposed over the past decades. In this thesis we introduce new tools to describe the coarse-grained dynamics of arbitrary observables in non-equilibrium processes. Following the projection operator formalisms introduced first by Mori and Zwanzig, and later on by Grabert, we first derive a non-stationary Generalized Langevin Equation that we prove to be valid in a wide spectrum of cases. This includes in particular driven processes as well as explicitly time-dependent observ- ables. The equation exhibits a priori memory effects, controlled by a so-called non- stationary memory kernel. Because the formalism does not provide extensive infor- mation about the memory kernel in general, we introduce a set of numerical meth- ods aimed at evaluating it from Molecular Dynamics simulation data. These proce- dures range from simple dimensionless estimations of the strength of the memory to the determination of the entire kernel. Again, the methods introduced are very general and require as input a small number of quantities directly computable from numerical of experimental timeseries. We finally conclude this thesis by using the projection operator formalisms to derive an equation of motion for work and heat in dissipative processes. This is done in two different ways, either by using well-known integral fluctuation theorems, or by explicitly splitting the dynamics into adiabatic and dissipative parts.},

abstract = {The equilibrium phase behavior of hard spheres with size polydispersity is studied theoretically. We solve numerically the exact phase equilibrium equations that result from accurate free energy expressions for the fluid and solid phases, while accounting fully for size fractionation between coexisting phases. Fluids up to the largest polydispersities that we can study (around 14{\%}) can phase separate by splitting off a solid with a much narrower size distribution. This shows that experimentally observed terminal polydispersities above which phase separation no longer occurs must be due to nonequilibrium effects. We find no evidence of reentrant melting; instead, sufficiently compressed solids phase separate into two or more solid phases. Under appropriate conditions, coexistence of multiple solids with a fluid phase is also predicted. The solids have smaller polydispersities than the parent phase as expected, while the reverse is true for the fluid phase, which contains predominantly smaller particles but also residual amounts of the larger ones. The properties of the coexisting phases are studied in detail; mean diameter, polydispersity, and volume fraction of the phases all reveal marked fractionation. We also propose a method for constructing quantities that optimally distinguish between the coexisting phases, using principal component analysis in the space of density distributions. We conclude by comparing our predictions to Monte Carlo simulations at imposed chemical potential distribution, and find excellent agreement. {\textcopyright} 2004 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to calculate the self-diffusion coefficient, D, of the hard sphere fluid over a wide density range and for different numbers of particles, N, between 32 and 10 976. These data are fitted to the relationship D = D∞ - AN -$\alpha$ where the parameters D∞, A, and $\alpha$ are all density-dependent (the temperature dependence of D can be trivially scaled out in all cases). The value $\alpha$ = 1/3 has been predicted on the basis of hydrodynamic arguments. In the studied system size range, the best value of $\alpha$ is ∼1/3 at intermediate packing fractions of ∼0.35, but increases in the low- and high-density extremes. At high density, the scaling follows more closely that of the thermodynamic properties, that is, with an exponent of order unity. At low packing fractions (less than ∼0.1), the exponent increases again, appearing to approach a limiting value of unity in the zero-density limit. The origin of this strong N dependence at low density probably lies in the divergence in the mean path between collisions, as compared with the dimensions of the simulation cell. A new simple analytical fit formula based on fitting to previous simulation data is proposed for the density dependence of the shear viscosity. The Stokes-Einstein relationship and the dependence of D on the excess entropy were also explored. The product D$\eta$sp with p = 0.975 was found to be approximately constant, with a value of 0.15 in the packing fraction range between 0.2 and 0.5. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The annual monomodal flood pulse of the Amazon River is a key driver for this globally important hydrological system. Understanding the behaviour and characteristics of this flood wave and its influence on the dynamics of river and floodplain interaction is important to many studies attempting to quantify processes dependent upon it, including estimates of carbon fluxes from the wetlands and sediment movement to the ocean. The main aim of the research presented in this thesis was to investigate the hydrodynamic behaviour of the Amazon River and its floodplain, in order to better understand its components and processes. The key scientific question underpinning this aim is: How do the floodplain storage and fluxes affect the passage of the Amazon flood wave and in turn how does the passage of the flood wave control the dynamics on the floodplain? Research was carried out using a synthesis of hydraulic characterisation, numerical modelling, spatial analysis of remote sensing data and field surveys. In combination with information from published floodplain studies, these results were then used to inform the development of a conceptual hydrodynamics framework for the Amazon floodplain. Hydraulic characterisation of the Amazon flood wave was undertaken showing that it is subcritical and diffusive in nature with dominating backwater effects. Experiments with the main channel using hydraulic models showed that main channel water levels were relatively insensitive (0.5 m error on a 12 m flood wave amplitude) to the geometric representation of the channel and that simplified bathymetry is adequate for calibrated predictions, provided the mean cross sectional area can be reasonably well approximated. Hydraulic model results compare well with observed data despite explicit exclusion of the floodplain, indicating that the storage volume of the floodplain has a minimal affect on the passage of the Amazon flood wave for this reach. The spatial analysis of Landsat TM images shows a total of 1,762 floodplain channels in the study area with a mean width of 47 m. Shuttle radar topography mission data has difficulty in resolving many of these floodplain channels due to 96{\%} of the channels having a width less than the SRTM spatial resolution of 90 m. Comparing floodplain channel widths with their frequency reveals a power law relationship, showing patterns of structure that are self-similar over many orders of magnitude. Analysis of the floodplain channel network connectivity showed that the complex floodplain can be divided into floodplain hydrologic units (FHU) and that each unit type has different geomorphic characteristics resulting from a different mixture of water inputs, with each unit isolated from other units for much of the flood cycle by sediment barriers. A field survey of the floodplain channels was conducted in order to measure and characterise their morphology. The findings of this survey together with numerical connectivity experiments, demonstrate that floodplain channels could be playing a much more significant role in the floodplain hydrodynamics then previously acknowledged. Floodplain channels were grouped into three types by depth: (i) for channels carrying only river flood water, depth was strongly correlated with the flood wave's mean annual range of 11.4 m; (ii) for channels which carried river flood water and local runoff, the mean depth was substantially deeper at 15.9 m; and, (iii) main river island channels were deeper again, with a mean depth of 17.7 m. Finally, a coherent, evidence based, conceptual floodplain hydrodynamics framework was developed to inform a broad range of future Amazon wetland research. The framework represents an extension to the macro level understanding available in the scientific literature and provides an important link between the macro and detailed level study scale.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine the phase behavior of the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential with $\beta$$\epsilon$ = 40. Crystal nucleation in this model system was recently studied by Kawasaki and Tanaka [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 14036 (2010)]10.1021/pr100656u, who argued that the computed nucleation rates agree well with experiment, a finding that contradicted earlier simulation results. Here we report an extensive numerical study of crystallization in the WCA model, using three totally different techniques (Brownian dynamics, umbrella sampling, and forward flux sampling). We find that all simulations yield essentially the same nucleation rates. However, these rates differ significantly from the values reported by Kawasaki and Tanaka and hence we argue that the huge discrepancy in nucleation rates between simulation and experiment persists. When we map the WCA model onto a hard-sphere system, we find good agreement between the present simulation results and those that had been obtained for hard spheres [L. Filion, M. Hermes, R.

abstract = {In molecular dynamics simulations and single molecule experiments, observables are usually measured along dynamic trajectories and then averaged over an ensemble ("bundle") of trajectories. Under stationary conditions, the time-evolution of such averages is described by the generalized Langevin equation. In contrast, if the dynamics is not stationary, it is not a priori clear which form the equation of motion for an averaged observable has. We employ the formalism of time-dependent projection operator techniques to derive the equation of motion for a non-equilibrium trajectoryaveraged observable as well as for its non-stationary auto-correlation function. The equation is similar in structure to the generalized Langevin equation, but exhibits a time-dependent memory kernel as well as a fluctuating force that implicitly depends on the initial conditions of the process. We also derive a relation between this memory kernel and the autocorrelation function of the fluctuating force that has a structure similar to a fluctuation-dissipation relation. In addition, we show how the choice of the projection operator allows to relate the Taylor expansion of the memory kernel to data that is accessible in MD simulations and experiments, thus allowing to construct the equation of motion. As a numerical example, the procedure is applied to Brownian motion initialized in non-equilibrium conditions, and is shown to be consistent with direct measurements from simulations.},

abstract = {Many-body simulations are very CPU-time consuming, making the problem of having efficient algorithms specially relevant. In this paper we propose a strategy--for the simulation of hard particle systems--that is efficient, memory saving, and easy to understand and to program. The time intervals by which the simulation proceeds are the increments between collisions (events), and these are dictated by the system itself. Hence these are event-driven simulations. Our strategy is devised to (a) minimize the number of coordinate updates per event, (b) predict new events only between nearby particles, and (c) efficiently manage the events predicted during the simulation. Empirical results are given to show the performance of our strategy in different computers as well as to compare with other approaches. It is seen that our proposed algorithm is efficient for a wide density range. We also include an analysis of the performance of the strategy proposed. {\textcopyright} 1993 by Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {Many standard structural quantities, such as order parameters and correlation functions, exist for common condensed matter systems, such as spherical and rod-like particles. However, these structural quantities are often insufficient for characterizing the unique and highly complex structures often encountered in the emerging field of nano and microscale self-assembly, or other disciplines involving complex structures such as computational biology. Computer science algorithms known as "shape matching" methods pose a unique solution to this problem by providing robust metrics for quantifying the similarity between pairs of arbitrarily complex structures. This pairwise matching operation, either implicitly or explicitly, lies at the heart of most standard structural characterization schemes for particle systems. By substituting more robust "shape descriptors" into these schemes we extend their applicability to structures formed from more complex building blocks. Here, we describe several structural characterization schemes and shape descriptors that can be used to obtain various types of structural information about particle systems. We demonstrate the application of shape matching algorithms to a variety of example problems, for topics including local and global structure identification and classification, automated phase diagram mapping, and the construction of spatial and temporal correlation functions. The methods are applicable to a wide range of systems, both simulated and experimental, provided particle positions are known or can be accurately imaged. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

B 28, 784 (1983)10.1103/PhysRevB.28.784] has become a standard tool in condensed matter physics, with applications including glass, jamming, melting or crystallization transitions, and cluster formation. Here, we discuss two fundamental flaws in the definition of these parameters that significantly affect their interpretation for studies of disordered systems, and offer a remedy. First, the definition of the bond-orientational order parameters considers the geometrical arrangement of a set of nearest neighboring (NN) spheres, NN(p), around a given central particle p; we show that the choice of neighborhood definition can have a bigger influence on both the numerical values and qualitative trend of ql than a change of the physical parameters, such as packing fraction. Second, the discrete nature of neighborhood implies that NN(p) is not a continuous function of the particle coordinates; this discontinuity, inherited by ql, leads to a lack of robustness of the ql as structure metrics. Both issues can be avoided by a morphometric approach leading to the robust Minkowski structure metrics ql′. These ql′ are of a similar mathematical form as the conventional bond-orientational order parameters and are mathematically equivalent to the recently introduced Minkowski tensors [G. E.

abstract = {Revised thermodynamic and dynamical properties of the hard sphere (HS) system are obtained from extensive molecular dynamics calculations carried out with large system sizes (number of particles, N) and long times. Accurate formulas for the compressibility factor of the HS solid and fluid branches are proposed, which represent the metastable region and take into account its divergence at close packing. Some basic second-order thermodynamic properties are obtained and a maximum in some of their derivatives in the metastable fluid region is found. The thermodynamic parameters associated with the melting-freezing transition have been determined to four digit accuracy, which generates accurate new values for the coexistence properties of the HS system. For the self-diffusion coefficient, D, it is shown that relatively large systems (N {\textgreater} 104) are required to achieve an accurate linear extrapolation of D to the infinite size limit with a D vs. N-1/3 plot. Moreover, it is found that there is a density dependence of the value of the slope in the linear regime. The density dependent correction becomes practically insignificant at higher densities and the hydrodynamic formula found in the literature is still accurate. However, with decreasing density the density dependence of the size correction cannot be neglected, which indicates that other sources of N-dependence, apart from those derived on purely hydrodynamic grounds, may also be important (and as yet unaccounted for). A detailed analytic representation of the density dependence of the HS self-diffusion coefficient and the HS viscosity, $\eta$, is given. It is shown that the HS viscosity near freezing and in the metastable region can be described well by the Krieger-Dougherty equation. Both D and $\eta$ start to scale at high densities and in the metastable region in such a way that D$\eta$p = const, where p ≃ 0.97, and D → 0 and $\eta$ → ∞ at a packing fraction of 0.58, which coincides with some previous predictions of the HS glass transition density.},

Here, we experimentally study crystal nucleation at the single particle level in suspensions of hard-sphere-like colloids under the influence of sedimentation. We find that sedimentation significantly enhances the nucleation rate, but contrary to what was previously thought, this is not due to simple density fluctuations, as the nucleation barriers become independent of the local density in a sedimentating fluid. Instead, we find an enhancement of the local dynamics, which suggests that local convective cells are responsible for shear-enhanced crystallization at low volume fractions.},

While the self-diffusion coefficient, D, and shear viscosity, $\eta$sv, increases and decreases, respectively, with increasing steepness in interaction potentials, the same SE relation holds for HS and WCA fluids as that obtained for LJ liquids, i.e., D$\eta$sv = (kBT/C)(N/V)1/3, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and N is the particle number included in the system volume V. The coefficient C is almost constant at about 6 to 2$\pi$ for $\eta$ {\textgreater} 0.3, where $\eta$ is the packing fraction. The results show that the SE relation for simple liquids and fluids does not need to bear any concepts of both the hydrodynamic particle size and the boundary condition. In light of this SE relation, the Enskog, Eyring-Ree, and Zwanzig theories are quantitatively tested. In addition, the cause of deviation from unity of the exponent in the fractional SE relation for simple fluids is clearly accounted for. The present results show that applying both the original and the fractional SE relations to simple liquids and fluids does not lead to any meaningful discussions.},

Moreover, the method is applied to simulate an even more sluggish event: the nucleation of the B2 phase in a strong glass-forming Cu-Zr alloy.

By substituting shape matching quantities for traditional quantities, we retain the essence of the broader scheme, but extend its applicability to more complex structures. Here we review some standard shape matching techniques and discuss how they might be used to create highly flexible structural metrics for diverse systems such as self-assembled matter. We provide three proof-of-concept example problems applying shape matching methods to identifying local and global structures, and tracking structural transitions in complex assembled systems.

The resulting nucleation rates are compared with the experimental rates of Harland and van Megen [Phys. Rev. E 55, 3054 (1997)], Sinn [Prog. Colloid Polym.

When the rates are examined in units of the long-time diffusion coefficient, we find agreement between all the theoretically predicted nucleation rates, however, the experimental results display a markedly different behavior for low supersaturation. Additionally, we examined the precritical nuclei arising in the molecular dynamics, forward flux sampling, and umbrella sampling simulations. The structure of the nuclei appears independent of the simulation method, and in all cases, the nuclei contains on average significantly more face-centered-cubic ordered particles than hexagonal-close-packed ordered particles. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

The method is designed to be applied in the simulation of hard-core models at high density. The algorithm is based in the generation of clusters of particles. At the volume change step, the distances between pairs of particles belonging to the same cluster do not change. This is done by rescaling the positions of the center of mass of each cluster instead of the position of each individual particle. We have tested the performance of the algorithm by simulating fluid and solid phases of hard spheres, finding that in both cases the algorithm is much more efficient than the standard procedure. Moreover, the efficiency of the method measured in terms of correlation "time" does not depend on the system size in contrast with the standard method, in which the sampling becomes rapidly inefficient as the system size increases. We have used the procedure to compute with high precision the equation of state of the face-centered-cubic phase of the hard sphere system for different system sizes. Using these results we have estimated the equation of state at the thermodynamic limit.

abstract = {We calculate the phase behavior of hard spheres with size polydispersity, using accurate free energies for the fluid and solid phases. Cloud and shadow curves are found exactly by the moment free energy method, but we also compute the complete phase diagram, taking full account of fractionation. In contrast to earlier, simplified treatments we find no point of equal concentration between fluid and solid or reentrant melting at higher densities. Rather, the fluid cloud curve continues to the largest polydispersity that we study (14{\%}); from the equilibrium phase behavior a terminal polydispersity can thus be defined only for the solid, where we find it to be around 7{\%}. At sufficiently large polydispersity, fractionation into several solid phases can occur, consistent with previous approximate calculations; we find, in addition, that coexistence of several solids with a fluid phase is also possible. {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Motivated by old experiments on colloidal suspensions, we report molecular dynamics simulations of assemblies of hard spheres, addressing crystallization and glass formation. The simulations cover wide ranges of polydispersity s (standard deviation of the particle size distribution divided by its mean) and particle concentration. No crystallization is observed for s {\textgreater} 0.07. For 0.02 {\textless} s {\textless} 0.07, we find that increasing the polydispersity at a given concentration slows down crystal nucleation. The main effect here is that polydispersity reduces the supersaturation since it tends to stabilize the fluid but to destabilize the crystal. At a given polydispersity ({\textless} 0.07), we find three regimes of nucleation: standard nucleation and growth at concentrations in and slightly above the coexistence region; 'spinodal nucleation', where the free-energy barrier to nucleation appears to be negligible, at intermediate concentrations; and, at the highest concentrations, a new mechanism, still to be fully understood, which only requires small rearrangement of the particle positions. The cross-over between the second and third regimes occurs at a concentration, approximately 58 per cent by volume, where the colloid experiments show a marked change in the nature of the crystals formed and the particle dynamics indicate an 'ideal' glass transition. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

DynamO provides reference implementations of the best available event-driven algorithms.

Significant differences are found between short and medium-length chains of different tacticity, while for long chains all shape measures converge to a common limit. The detailed three-dimensional segment density distributions are examined, and they are found to be bimodal along the longest principal axis of gyration. The loci of highest segment density are always two clearly separated domains, not containing the center of gyration, and they lie on the major principal axis separated by ca. 1.3〈S2〉01/2-2.0〈S2〉01/2.

abstract = {Crystal nucleation is a much-studied phenomenon, yet the rate at which it occurs remains difficult to predict. Small crystal nuclei form spontaneously in supersaturated solutions, but unless their size exceeds a critical value-the so-called critical nucleus-they will re-dissolve rather than grow. It is this rate-limiting step that has proved difficult to probe experimentally. The crystal nuclea tion rate depends on Pcrit, the (very small) probability that a critical nucleus forms spontaneously, and on a kinetic factor (ic) that measures the rate at which critical nuclei subsequently grow. Given the absence of a priori knowledge of either quantity, classical nucleation theory' is commonly used to analyse crystal nucleation experiments, with the unconstrained parameters adjusted to fit the observations. This approach yields no 'first principles' prediction of absolute nucleation rates. Here we approach the problem from a different angle, simulating the nucleation process in a suspension of hard colloidal spheres, to obtain quantitative numerical predictions of the crystal nuclea tion rate. We find large discrepancies between the computed nucleation rates and those deduced from experiments the best experimental estimates of Pcrit seem to be too large by several orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {We present a new simulation method for the calculation of crystal nucleation rates by computer simulation. The method is based on the use of molds to induce crystallization in state points where nucleation is a rare event. The mold is a cluster of potential energy wells placed in the lattice positions of the solid. The method has two distinct steps. In the first one the probability per unit volume of forming a sub-critical crystal cluster in the fluid is computed by means of thermodynamic integration. The thermodynamic route consists in gradually switching on an attractive interaction between the wells and the fluid particles. In the second step, the frequency with which such cluster becomes post-critical is computed in Molecular Dynamics simulations with the mold switched on. We validate our method with a continuous version of the hard sphere potential and with the sodium chloride Tosi-Fumi model. In all studied state points we obtain a good agreement with literature data obtained from other rare event simulation techniques. Our method is quite suitable for the study of both crystal nucleation of arbitrarily complex structures and the competition between different polymorphs in the nucleation stage.},

abstract = {One of the biggest unresolved problems in crystallization phenomena is the significant discrepancy in the nucleation rate between experiments and simulations even for the simplest liquid, i.e., the hard-sphere system. A popular explanation for this discrepancy is the neglect of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) in simulation studies. By comparing simulations with and without HI, we show that the long-time diffusive dynamics of the colloids is slowed down more rapidly by hydrodynamic lubrication effects with increasing volume fraction. We find that the kinetics of both nucleation and growth are controlled by this long-time diffusion and that it is possible to account for most of the effects of HI by rescaling with this timescale. Therefore, we conclude that HI is not the primary cause of the accelerated nucleation rates observed in experiments.},

abstract = {Twenty two different analytical expressions for the compressibility factor of the hard sphere system have been collected and reviewed in order to perform two applications: Firstly, the accuracy of these expressions in reproducing six available computer simulation data sets for the hard sphere system, some of which are very recent, is tested. It is shown that there is not a direct relation between the simplicity or complexity of their analytical form and their accuracy. Secondly, the expressions, together with the Verlet-Weis formula for the temperature dependence of the molecular diameter, have been used to reproduce our molecular dynamics results for the pressure of the Lennard-Jones reference system proposed in the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen theory. We conclude that the approximation of using hard sphere equations of state together with the Verlet-Weis formula is very accurate at temperatures and densities near the Lennard-Jones critical point. At densities close to the triple point or to the liquid curve in the liquid-vapour equilibrium, the coincidence is adequate (deviations around 3{\%}) only if the appropriate hard sphere equation of state is used.},

By restricting the variational spaces, various approximations are derived. They provide equations of motion best suited to the quantity to be measured. In particular, time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) appears as the best mean-field equation for predicting averages of single-particle observables. Other meanfield formalisms are derived, which are fitted to the prediction of other observables, such as fluctuations or transition probabilities. In the later case, known coupled equations are recovered and discussed. The variational principle for a state and an observable also provides an alternative class of generalized mean-fields, when time-dependent states with maximum entropy are chosen as trial states.

Therefore, molecular interaction based simulations are often used to properly express velocity and temperature slips at high Knudsen numbers (Kn) seen at dilute gases or narrow channels. In this study, an event-driven molecular dynamics (EDMD) simulation is proposed to estimate properties of hard-sphere gas flows. Considering molecules as hard-spheres, trajectories of the molecules, collision partners, corresponding interaction times, and postcollision velocities are computed deterministically using discrete interaction potentials. On the other hand, boundary interactions are handled stochastically. Added to that, in order to create a pressure gradient along the channel, an implicit treatment for flow boundaries is adapted for EDMD simulations. Shear-Driven (Couette) and Pressure-Driven flows for various channel configurations are simulated to demonstrate the validity of suggested treatment. Results agree well with DSMC method and solution of linearized Boltzmann equation. At low Kn, EDMD produces similar velocity profiles with Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations and slip boundary conditions, but as Kn increases, N-S slip models overestimate slip velocities.},

abstract = {Over the last number of years several simulation methods have been introduced to study rare events such as nucleation. In this paper we examine the crystal nucleation rate of hard spheres using three such numerical techniques: molecular dynamics, forward flux sampling, and a Bennett-Chandler-type theory where the nucleation barrier is determined using umbrella sampling simulations. The resulting nucleation rates are compared with the experimental rates of Harland and van Megen [Phys. Rev. E 55, 3054 (1997)], Sinn [Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 118, 266 (2001)], Schtzel and Ackerson [Phys. Rev. E 48, 3766 (1993)], and the predicted rates for monodisperse and 5{\%} polydisperse hard spheres of Auer and Frenkel [Nature 409, 1020 (2001)]. When the rates are examined in units of the long-time diffusion coefficient, we find agreement between all the theoretically predicted nucleation rates, however, the experimental results display a markedly different behavior for low supersaturation. Additionally, we examined the precritical nuclei arising in the molecular dynamics, forward flux sampling, and umbrella sampling simulations. The structure of the nuclei appears independent of the simulation method, and in all cases, the nuclei contains on average significantly more face-centered-cubic ordered particles than hexagonal-close-packed ordered particles. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},
