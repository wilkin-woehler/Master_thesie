@article{Chen1988,
abstract = {Consider a life testing experiment in which n units are put on test, successive failure times are recorded, and the observation is terminated either at a specified number r of failures or a specified time T whichever is reached first. This mixture of type I and type II censoring schemes, called hybrid censoring, is of wide use. Under this censoring scheme and the assumption of an exponential life distribution, the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator of the mean life $\theta$ is derived. It is then used to construct an exact lower confidence bound for $\theta$. {\textcopyright} 1988, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

@article{Deemer1955,
abstract = {A general weak convergence theory is developed for time-sequential censored rank statistics in the two-sample problem of comparing time to failure between two treatment groups, such as in the case of a clinical trial in which patients enter serially and, after being randomly allocated to one of two treatments, are followed until they fail or withdraw from the study or until the study is terminated. Applications of the theory to time-sequential tests based on these censored rank statistics are also discussed.},

@article{Filion2011,
abstract = {In this paper we examine the phase behavior of the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential with $\beta$$\epsilon$ = 40. Crystal nucleation in this model system was recently studied by Kawasaki and Tanaka [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 14036 (2010)]10.1021/pr100656u, who argued that the computed nucleation rates agree well with experiment, a finding that contradicted earlier simulation results. Here we report an extensive numerical study of crystallization in the WCA model, using three totally different techniques (Brownian dynamics, umbrella sampling, and forward flux sampling). We find that all simulations yield essentially the same nucleation rates. However, these rates differ significantly from the values reported by Kawasaki and Tanaka and hence we argue that the huge discrepancy in nucleation rates between simulation and experiment persists. When we map the WCA model onto a hard-sphere system, we find good agreement between the present simulation results and those that had been obtained for hard spheres [L. Filion, M. Hermes, R. Ni, and M. Dijkstra, J. Chem. Phys. 133, 244115 (2010)10.1063/1.3506838; S. Auer and D. Frenkel, Nature 409, 1020 (2001)10.1038/35059035 {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},
