	\newcommand{\presummary}{Nucleation and cluster development in the metastable hard sphere fluid are studied in this thesis. To this purpose an event driven molecular dynamcis simulation code is written and thouroughly tested by measuring well known quantities like diffusion coefficients or radial distribution functions at various packing fractions. Its performance is well suited for systems of about one million particles enabling the measurement of cluster growth rates and shape descriptors for clusters with sizes up to a hundred thousand particles without significant spatial influence of the cluster on to itself due to the periodic boundary conditions.\\ 
During the cluster growth a constant attachment rate to the cluster surface is measured, suprisingly unaffected by the packing fraction of the surrounding mestastable liquid. But the attachemnt rate may vary between single clusters by about 50\% leading to uncertainties that do not exclude a dependence on the diffusion time.\\
For the shape descriptors based on the Tensor of Gyrationa tendency towards more spherical clusters is observed up to sizes of about a thousand particles. Clusters including more particles seem to conserve their almost spherical proportions and approach the complelty spherical shape only slowly.\\  
Also the nucleation rate at volume fractions of $\eta \in [53.1\%,53.4\%]$ are measured at high precision compared to earlier measurements of these, but also confirming the discrepancy between real world and simulation experiments. Beyond that the memory kernels of nucleation for smaller systems are investigated finding a rather featureless Gaussian kernel. The width of the Gaussian kernel therby is comparable to the width of the phase transition time for a single trajectory.}
