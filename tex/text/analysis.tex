\section{Data analysis}
\label{sec:data_analysis}
This is the analysis part

\subsection{Diffusion of the lqiuid}
This contain analysis of diffusion in the liquid to prove the simulations accuray

\subsection{Diffusion of the metastable liquid}
This contains Diffusion constants to normalize the rates

\subsection{Cluster growth}
Cluster growth depending on density

\subsection{ToG}
Well only swamp here, but it can be shown to conclude the swamp.

\subsection{ACF largest cluster?}
Just in case anything can be seen here

\subsection{Induction time dilemma}
Evaluation of induction time. Prolem with accuracy and precision. Compare methods.

\subsection{Induction time by exponential distribution}
Obtain exp assumption and best estimator

\subsection{Nucleation rate comparison}
All Nucleation rates that can be found.-> mayhap ask Hajo.

\subsection{Memory Kernels}
Memory kernels of systems at various densities. Depends strongly on what is found here
