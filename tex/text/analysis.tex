\label{chp:data_analysis}
This is the analysis part

\section{Diffusion of the lqiuid}
\label{sec:diffusion_liquid}
This contain analysis of diffusion in the liquid to prove the simulations accuray

\section{Diffusion of the metastable liquid}
\label{sec:diffusion_metastable_liquid}
This contains Diffusion constants to normalize the rates

\section{Cluster growth}
\label{sec:Cluster growth}
Cluster growth depending on density

\section{Tensor of Gyration properties}
\label{sec:tog}
Well only swamp here, but it can be shown to conclude the swamp.

\section{ACF largest cluster?}
\label{sec:acf}
Just in case anything can be seen here

\section{Nuclection time dilemma}
\label{sec:nucleation_times}
Evaluation of induction time. Prolem with accuracy and precision. Compare methods.

\section{Induction time by exponential distribution}
\label{sec:induction_times}
Obtain exp assumption and best estimator

\section{Nucleation rate comparison}
\label{sec:nucleation_rates}
All Nucleation rates that can be found.-> mayhap ask Hajo.

\section{Memory Kernels}
\label{sec:memory_kernels}
Memory kernels of systems at various densities. Depends strongly on what is found here
