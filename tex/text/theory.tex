\section{Theory and Background}
\label{sec:theory}

\subsection{Hard sphere system}
Explain the Hard sphere system and the first predictions of the phase transition

\subsection{metastable fluid/ phase diagram}
maybe include disperisty of radii

\subsection{Classical nucleation theory :/}
Estimate of $r_{crit}$ by $\Delta_{\mu}$\\
SOmehow this wshould be doable ;)

\subsection{Computer Precision}
Explain a little about what numerics does, compared to the real world.\\
Maybe include the time evolution of minimal changes

\subsection{Comparsion to Real world experiments} 
Compare, regadring the solvent. Esspeically with Hajos finding.
