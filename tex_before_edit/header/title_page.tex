{\Large\textbf{Declaration of originality}}\\

{\large Herewith I affirm that the submitted master thesis was written autonomously by myself and that I did not use any other sources and auxiliaries than declared in this work. Under the acknowledged rules of scientific work (lege artis) literal or analogous   content   borrowed   from   the   work   of   others   was appropriately identified. Furthermore, I insure that the submitted master thesis is not and was never part of any other examination procedures, either complete or in substantial parts.\par}
