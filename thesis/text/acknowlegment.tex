First of all, i want to thank Tanja Schilling for granting me a lot of freedom, while always hinting relevant details and for providing the large resources for the simulation study. Secondly, i want to thank Anja Kuhnbold for the short line of communication that helped solve many small questions. And then, i want to thank Hugues Meyer and Fabian Glatzel, as they elaborated and developed the theoretical and numerical base on which the memory kernel analysis relies.\\

Further, the author acknowledges support by the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg through bwHPC
and the German Research Foundation (DFG) through grant no INST 39/963-1 FUGG (bwForCluster NEMO).
